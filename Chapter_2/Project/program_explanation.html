  <h3>Greeting Program Using JavaScript</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Here's a simple example of an 
    <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and 
    JavaScript code snippet that creates a page with an input 
    field for the user's name. When the user types their name and clicks 
    the "Submit" button, it will display the 
    greeting "Hello, [<var>name</var>]".
  </p>
  <p>
    When you open this HTML page in a browser, it will allow you 
    to enter your name, for example <kbd>Valery</kbd>, and upon submission, 
    it will display the greeting message <samp>Hello, Valery!</samp> on the same page.  
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Simple Greeting Page&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Enter your name:&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;<span class="green">form</span> id="nameForm"&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" id="nameInput" placeholder=<span class="green">"Your Name"</span>&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value=<span class="green">"Submit"</span>&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;

      <span class="yellow">&lt;div id="greeting" style="display: none;"&gt;</span>
        &lt;h2&gt;Greeting:&lt;/h2&gt;
        <span class="blue">&lt;p id="greetingText"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span>
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;script&gt;
        document.getElementById("nameForm").addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
            <span class="pink">event.preventDefault();</span> // Prevent form submission
            <span class="green">var name = document.getElementById("nameInput").value;</span>
            <span class="red">var greetingText = "Hello, " + name + "!";</span>
            <span class="blue">document.getElementById("greetingText").textContent = greetingText;</span>
            <span class="yellow">document.getElementById("greeting").style.display = "block";</span>
        });
      &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    In this code:<br>
    We have an input field with the placeholder <span class="green">"Your Name"</span> 
    and a <span class="green">"Submit"</span> button inside a <span class="green">form</span> element.
    When the user submits the form, the JavaScript code prevents 
    the default form submission behavior using <span class="pink">event.preventDefault()</span>.
    It then retrieves the value entered in the input field, 
    <span class="red">constructs the greeting message</span>, and displays it in a <span class="blue">&lt;p&gt;</span> 
    element with the <span class="blue">id "greetingText."</span>
    The <span class="yellow">"greeting" &lt;div&gt; element</span> is initially hidden with 
    <span class="yellow">style="display: none;"</span> and is set to be displayed 
    <span class="yellow">(style.display = "block";)</span> after the user submits the form.
  </p>
  <p>
    This program contains embedded Cascading Style Sheets (<dfn>CSS</dfn>) code.
    It's just a simplified example of how JavaScript can be used to 
    interact with the HTML page.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code was created using requirements provided in the 
    book <cite>"Web Programming with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"</cite> by John Dean:
  </p>
  <pre><blockquote>
    "Create a web page with a filename of pgmExplanation.html that explains something inter-
    esting about a program. Your explanation must make sense. You must use grammatically correct
    sentences that provide a reasonable flow through your web page. Creativity and aesthetics are part
    of web programming, and they are part of this assignment. Follow these guidelines:
        ▸▸ Include at least one heading (h1, h2, etc.) in your web page.
        ▸▸ Display a code fragment from the program, or display the whole program, if appropriate.
      Feel free to create the program yourself or use a program that you find in a book or on the
      Internet.
        ▸▸ Refer to a specific variable in the program, specific input, and specific output.
        ▸▸ Provide a quote from a book that refers to the program or to a concept illustrated by the
      program, and provide a citation for the book’s title. Feel free to use a real quote from a real
      book or make up a fictional quote from a fictional book.
        ▸▸ Provide an acronym (real or made up) or a definition that somehow relates to the web
      page’s discussion.
        ▸▸ Include a total of at least 10 different types of phrasing elements in your web page. You
      must use appropriate phrasing elements that fit the flow of your web page. You will lose
      points if any of your elements are inappropriate (e.g., using wbr in a normal-length word).
      For future projects, you will use CSS for formatting. But for practice purposes, for this project, use
      only HTML5 elements and not CSS."
