# "Web Programming with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript" by John Dean

### Code examples, projects, solutions to exercises, and answers to review questions for the book

John Dean's book is great for understanding the basics of web programming. I highly recommend that you solve all exercises by yourself. Don't copy-paste blindly without understanding the examples.

All answers to Review Questions and solutions for Exercises are based on the book itself and credible web sources like specifications, references and style guides by W3C, Google, Mozilla, etc.
