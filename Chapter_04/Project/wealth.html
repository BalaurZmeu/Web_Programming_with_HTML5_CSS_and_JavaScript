  <h1>The American Dream</h1>
  <p>Work hard and become wealthy?</p>
  <p>Maybe so, but work alone might not cut it. The following
  graphs<a href="#linker"><sup>[1]</sup></a> show various paths
  to prosperity.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
  More advanced schooling helps. If you can avoid the crushing
  debt of student loans, all the better. Try to find a major
  that you're good at and that is good to you.

<h2>Birthright</h2>
<p>
  For accruing wealth, what's even better than education?
  Being born wealthy. In the graph below, note how the
  birthright high enders are able to become more wealthy than
  the education high enders. So before being born, shop around.
